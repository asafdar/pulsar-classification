## Classification of Pulsars With Various Machine Learning Methods

This project utilizes the [Predicting a Pulsar Star](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star/) dataset from Kaggle. The purpose is to use different machine learning models to predict whether a star is a pulsar or not a pulsar, in order to determine the most accurate model.
