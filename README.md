## Classification of Pulsars With Various Machine Learning Methods

This project utilizes the [Predicting a Pulsar Star](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star/) dataset from Kaggle. The purpose is to determine the most accurate model in predicting whether or not a star is a pulsar.

### Models

The models I used were:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- SVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Random Forest
- Adaboost

### Results

My most accurate model was SVM (SGD). This surprised me, as I had expected an ensemble method like Random Forest or AdaBoost to have the highest accuracy.
